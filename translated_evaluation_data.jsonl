{"instruction": "What happens if a player's clothing accidentally touches the ball during a match?", "response": "If the ball touches a player's body or clothing during play, it is considered a lost point and the opponent scores.

{"instruction": "In a doubles match, what happens if one player is injured and can't continue?", "response": "If a player is injured and cannot continue within a reasonable time, the umpire may terminate the match and award the victory to the opponent. Short-term treatment may be allowed, but prolonged delays are not permitted."}
{"instruction": "Can the ball bounce twice on the table during a serve?", "response": "No. During a serve, the ball must bounce once on the server’s side, then cross the net and land on the receiver’s side. If it bounces twice on either side, it results in a lost point."}
{"instruction": "What is the ruling if the ball hits a chandelier or the ceiling?", "response": "If the ball hits any venue equipment such as the ceiling or lights without first touching the table, it is ruled a lost point. Such equipment is considered outside the bounds of the playing area."}

{"instruction": "What should be done if there is a sudden power outage during a match?", "response": "If a power outage or other unexpected incident interrupts play, the umpire may suspend the match. The match resumes once conditions are restored, and all completed scores remain valid."}
{"instruction": "Can a coach give instructions to players at any time during the match?", "response": "No. Coaches may only provide instructions between games or during timeouts. Verbal or gestural coaching during play is considered a violation and may result in a warning."}
{"instruction": "If the ball bounces twice before being returned, does it count as a point?", "response": "No, it's not a legal return. If the ball bounces twice on the opponent’s side without being struck, it counts as a point for the striker. The ball must be returned after a single bounce."}
{"instruction": "Can a player hide the ball with the paddle during a serve?", "response": "No. The ball must be fully visible to the opponent throughout the service motion. Hiding the ball with the body or paddle is a service violation and will be penalized by the umpire."}
